# BoxLinux
In early stage of development - updates soon!

ALWAYS DOWNLOAD RELEASES, THE MASTER BRANCH IS WORK IN PROGRESS!

Boxmaker runs well on OpenSUSE Tumbleweed and it's the recommended host OS.

Almost ready for Beta2 release which will include ISO image for VBox,a pre-compiled generic kernel and tools, in case you don't want to build them yourself.

A self-hosted, better maintained repo comming soon! It will be backed up here.

The documentation is now in html format, BOXLINUX_HOWTO.html

Please read it. This documentation will become a website, hosted on a VPS running BoxLinux, as soon as I manage to get it running well.

This repo is dependent on the boxbuilds repo (https://github.com/geonaumov/boxbuilds). The script will anyway automatically pull the latest version.
