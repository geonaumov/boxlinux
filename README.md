# BoxLinux
In early stage of development - updates soon!

Boxmaker runs well on OpenSUSE Tumbleweed and it's the recommended host OS.

It's also able to recompile itself (BoxLinux as host OS). 

ISO image for VBox and Hyper-V soon!

The documentation is in html format, BOXLINUX_HOWTO.html but is still work in progress.
